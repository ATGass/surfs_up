  * The lowest temperatures represent extremes and not a true representation of the data.

* There also isn't much of a difference between precipitation averages. The average for June was .14 and the average for December was .22. 

## Summary
Overall weather is steady year-round. There is about a 3 degree temperature differnce between the quartiles and averages of June and December. There are hardly any differences in precipitation which means that the rain would interfere at the same rate no matter the time of year. Another query that would be heplful that's not available at this time would be to understand that best locations on each island based on popularity and how many similar shops are in the area. Another query that might be helpful would be to take the overall summary of statistics to see if they align similarly to June and December to ensure that those two months aren't anomolies.
